DECIDE IF A GIVEN NUMBER IS EVEN OR ODD
Step 1: Get the value of a number
Step 2: To verify if the number is even or odd, divide it by 2
Step 3: If the previous step gave you a full number(a number without a decimal), then the number from STEP 1 is even
Step 4: else
Step 5: If STEP 2 gave you a remainder(a number with a decimal), then the number from STEP 1 is odd
Step 6: Print the characteristic of your number from STEP 1; Even or Odd?


Ex: 
Step 1: Get the value of a number
        7
Step 2: To verify if a number is even, divide it by 2
        7/2 = 3.5
Step 3: If the previous step gave you a full number(a number without a decimal), then the number from STEP 1 is even
        3.5 is not a full number --> not even
Step 4: else
Step 5: If STEP 2 gave you a remainder(a number with a decimal), then the number from STEP 1 is odd
        3.5 has a remainder --> odd
Step 6: Print the characteristic of your number from STEP 1; Even or Odd?
        7 is an odd number
